In order to ensure functionality and security I first had to map out the parameters of what was being asked of the prompt like for example rejecting the null and character limits. In addition to this I also needed to ensure that the proper input validation measures are in place to protect the teams important assets as well as ensure that the proper steps were being taken. When I had all of my parameters laid out I used automated JUnit tests to check the overall integrity of the code and insure that it was performing the desired functions when necessary with at least an 80% coverage rate.

*How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs are interpreted through feedback like testimonials and creating user stories, as well as the client laying out the parameters of what the users will expect from the program.
